# Mapping Open Source in Museums

**See the site!** ðŸ’˜ðŸ’«ðŸ¦„ --> https://geealbers.github.io/mapping-open-source/

Welcome to the *Mapping Open Source in Museums* project. This is an effort to understand the use and creation of open source code within the museum community. The project focuses specifically on exploring code written by museums and used by other museums, rather than on museumsâ€™ use of other open source projects. The visualizations and data shown on this site are pulled from GitHubâ€™s API based on [a running list](data/museums.yml) of identified museum GitHub accounts. For now, the accounts are limited strictly to those connected directly to a museum, though in the future should be expanded to include external vendors and firms who do work on behalf of museums.

This project was sparked by [a brief Twitter conversation](https://twitter.com/danamuses/status/987411673496498177) in the spring of 2018, and is built in the footsteps of MuseTech Central ([original web version](https://web.archive.org/web/20121130230106/http://musetechcentral.org/), and [GitHub reincarnation](https://github.com/MuseCompNet/muse-tech-central/)), and [Museums on GitHub](https://github.com/Ambrosiani/museums-on-github). This site itself is built on [Hugo](https://github.com/gohugoio/hugo), and uses [D3](https://github.com/d3/d3) for many of the visualizations.
